#hello
i'm a 13 year old girl. i've been programming since i was ten or eleven
i mainly do web developing since i know html, css, and js (including processing.js and jquery) but i'm also learning python, php, ruby, sql, and can use the command line fairly well. i just started learning git since i made an acct here!
